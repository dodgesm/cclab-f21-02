    <h2>The Laughing Heart</h2>
    <br>your life is your life <br>
    don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission. <br>
    be on the watch.<br>
    there are ways out.<br>
    there is light somewhere.<br>
    it may not be much light but <br>
    it beats the darkness. <br>
    be on the watch. <br>
    the gods will offer you chances. <br>
    know them. <br>
    take them.<br>
    you can’t beat death but <br>
    you can beat death in life, sometimes. <br>
    and the more often you learn to do it, <br>
    the more light there will be.<br>
    your life is your life. <br>
    know it while you have it. <br>
    you are marvelous <br>
    the gods wait to delight <br>
    in you. <br>
