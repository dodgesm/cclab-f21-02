    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Bukowski uses "Bluebird" to describe the speaker's relationships with thier emotions. The bluebird in the poem represents the speaker's kinder and more gentle emotions that they hide behind a hard exterior. According to Bukowski, society is structured to see these softer emotions as vulnerability that should be oppressed.</p>

<h2>Bluebird</h2>
    there's a bluebird in my heart that <br>
    wants to get out <br>
    but I'm too tough for him, <br>
    I say, stay in there, I'm not going <br>
    to let anybody see <br>
    you. <br>
    there's a bluebird in my heart that <br>
    wants to get out <br>
    but I pour whiskey on him and inhale <br>
    cigarette smoke <br>
    and the whores and the bartenders <br>
    and the grocery clerks <br>
    never know that <br>
    he's <br>
    in there. <br>

    <br>there's a bluebird in my heart that <br>
    wants to get out <br>
    but I'm too tough for him, <br>
    I say, <br>
    stay down, do you want to mess <br>
    me up? <br>
    you want to screw up the <br>
    works? <br>
    you want to blow my book sales in <br>
    Europe? <br>
    there's a bluebird in my heart that <br>
    wants to get out <br>
    but I'm too clever, I only let him out <br>
    at night sometimes <br>
    when everybody's asleep. <br>
    I say, I know that you're there, <br>
    so don't be <br>
    sad. <br>
    then I put him back, <br>
    but he's singing a little <br>
    in there, I haven't quite let him <br>
    die <br>
    and we sleep together like <br>
    that <br>
    with our <br>
    secret pact <br>
    and it's nice enough to <br>
    make a man <br>
    weep, but I don't <br>
    weep, do <br>
    you? <br>
